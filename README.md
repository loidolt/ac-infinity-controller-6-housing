## General Info
I am using an AC Infinity Cloudline 6 fan to cool my server rack and needed a way to mount this controller to the top of the rack. The controller is designed to accommodate being panel or wall mounted, but not to a horizontal surface. This housing secures the controller using just a little mounting tape quickly and easily.

## Technologies
- Fusion 360

## Setup
Print the housing, screw the controller in, and mount to a surface using mounting tape.
